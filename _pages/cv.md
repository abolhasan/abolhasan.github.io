I am currently looking for new PhD students to work on the following topics:

Project Title: High-Speed, Low-Power and Secure Technologies for Internet of Things Applications

Project Description: Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key technologies with the potential to create a multi-trillion-dollar Industry. IoT is already making significant impact on many existing Industries in a number of ways. This includes enabling business process improvements and better management of operations at scale, while opening ever-growing niche business opportunities. The existing impact of IoT can be seen in many numbers of Industries such as Agriculture, Mining and Transportation, where IoT has played a major role in enabling automation and monitoring. However, with the proposition of new technologies such as 5G, which provide a platform to develop and provision new types of services, the range of applications for IoT is set to grow. This includes a new generation of tactile applications and services with mission critical operations, such as remote surgery, driverless cars and more. Each new application may introduce new research challenges before an IoT solution can be successfully developed. Across a range of challenges mentioned above some of the key research challenges that IoT faces includes: 1. Security and 2. Application specific Connectivity. In terms of Security, much research still needs to be conducted to ensure IoT Devices and the data they generate are secure. This problem needs to be addressed at different stages and layers of the IoT stack. In terms of Application specific connectivity, since IoT devices have different transmission and QoS requirements, this issue will have to be addressed based on the application requirement. For example, one application may require low data-rate but long-range connectivity, and another may require ultra-reliable connectivity with low-delay and high-speed connectivity. Furthermore, another application may require each IoT device to be located in places where recharging of batteries may not be feasible, hence the IoT devices must operate and transmit data in an energy efficient manner. This project will explore a number of research topics based on the above challenges.

Where will the research be conducted: The above research will be conducted in the RFCT lab at UTS, which is a new lab with state of art facility, enabling design, modelling and prototyping of next generation IoT devices.

Training and research opportunities: You will develop your skills in designing IoT, working with potential industry partners, developing new innovative IoT technologies solving real-world problems.

What we are looking for: You will ideally have a First-class Honours or a Masters by research. You will have skills in programming (required), good knowledge of communications technologies and protocols (required), Electronics prototyping (desired), Machine learning and analytics (desired)

Title: Software Defined Network Architecture and protocol design for Next generation Wireless networks

Project Description:Over the past 10 years there has been a rapid growth and development in Wireless networking. Wireless networks have rapidly evolved over three generations reaching the current 5G wireless networking standard. 5G is seen as a major leap forward in innovation in wireless networking as it introduces higher levels of programmability and adaptability to achieve significantly better performance than 4G wireless networks. A key enabling technology in 5G is Software Defined Networking (SDN). By untangling the control and data plane from switching and routing devices, SDN enables for a more rapid innovation in the world of networking. This rapid innovation is set to accelerate the development of new generation of protocols and architectures for 5G Wireless and Beyond. However, SDN not only enables Wireless Networks to evolve quickly, but it provides the building blocks to allow them to operate much more efficiently and intelligently through the integration of AI/Machine Learning (ML) strategies.

This project will investigate into how different AI/ML strategies can be used to increase the scalability, operational efficiency and security of Wireless networks. The project will seek to develop new intelligent protocols and algorithms for 5G and beyond wireless networks (including 6G).

Experience Needed: Strong mathematical background, Knowledge of AI/ML, Strong knowledge of Wireless networking, Solid scripting and programming in languages such as C ++ and Python.

Title: Enabling Mission Critical Communications over Wireless Networks

Project Description: Wireless networks have transformed the way we communicate, socialise and conduct our daily work. Wireless Network enabled the birth of a diverse range of applications over the past 10 years. Such applications range from gaming, social networking all the way to various types of business applications. However, many of such applications have been designed with one key limitation in mind. That is, Wireless network tend to be unreliable. It is not uncommon to see network dropouts or link failures as you travel and use various networking application. This limitation is generally tolerated and enables above application to continue to operate without significant impact on their operation once a link is restored. However, with the emergence of 5G Wireless networks, which promises to provide high level of capacity and reliability, the question is being asked now: Can wireless network be made reliable and agile enough to run Mission Critical applications? Mission Critical applications must operate over networks which have high levels of reliability otherwise it could result in catastrophic outcomes such as loss of life. There are a diverse range of applications, which would benefit from a Wireless network which can achieve a high level of reliability and low-latency. These applications range from Vehicular Network communications and Coordination, Telehealth/Remote Surgery, management of Industrial IoT sensor and actuations and more.

This project will conduct detailed investigation in the various layers of the current Wireless communications stack and propose new models, algorithms and protocols which aim to enhance the reliability of wireless networks and reduce communications latency.

Experience Needed: Strong mathematical background, Knowledge of Optimisation techniques, AI/ML, Strong knowledge of Wireless networking, Solid scripting and programming in languages such as C ++ and Python.
